## Requirements:

  - Python v3.6
  - OpenCV v3.0
  - tesseract-ocr
  - libimobiledevice
  

Run the following command to install all the modules

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Afterwards you will need to get setup with OpenCV, follow the instructions here:

### OpenCV 3.0 with Python 3.6

This might take a while

Next you will need tesseract, https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki

Finally, you will need libimobiledevice. I just used the binary distribution found here: https://github.com/benvium/libimobiledevice-macosx
